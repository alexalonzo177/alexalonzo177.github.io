      <h1>Strange Dark Areas</h1>

      <p> This series was inspired by a quote that goes, "There's a safety in thinking in a diner. You can have your coffee or your milkshake, and you can go off into strange dark areas, and always come back to the safety of the diner." This inspired me to explore the sinister side of daydreams. The series starts with the subject reading a book and enjoying coffee. The following images go to the aforementioned strange dark areas the mind is capable of imagining. I played with lighting and the idea of the unknown to see how that can perturb or cause anxiety to the viewer. </p>
