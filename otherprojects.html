    <h3>Banal is Good, Multi Media Video, 2019</h3>
    <p>Originally this started out as a storyboard, but with the video and sound element, it’s now more of a short film. The concept behind the storyboard is photographically interpreted song lyrics; I listened to the song ‘Black is Good’ by Young Rival and picked out lyrics that I found compelling. I then imagined the lyrics as scenes and did my best to make those a reality. The end result came out to be the story of a working man coming home for the night.</p>

    <h3>Warm & Cool, Code Art, 2019</h3>
    <p> The work is an interactive city scape. The viewer has the choice between making the city scene day or night. In the work there is a moving sun and moon for the respective scenes. This adds a minigame element where the viewer can switch the time of day when the moon rises or sets. This makes the work more narrative; the viewer can imagine time passing in this imaginary place and the viewer can control when the day is over. </p>
