      <p> In this body of work I photographed artists of different disciplines in the areas they spend the majority of their time doing their work. Before I made this, I practiced doing portraits with my large format camera on darkroom paper. I was drawn to this process because paper retains the same quality as film, but is easier and quicker to develop. This left me with a paper negative, which by itself is lackluster. I wanted something more out of the images since the quality was high and I went through a lot of effort to make them, so I got the idea to hand color them. </p>
